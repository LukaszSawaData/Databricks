# Databricks_terraform
## Description

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing Databricks Unity Catalog. Unity Catalog provides a unified governance solution for all data and AI assets in your Databricks environment, enabling you to manage and secure your data more effectively.

- **Provisioning**: Automate the setup of Unity Catalog resources.
- **Configuration**: Define and manage access controls, data lineage, and audit logging.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing Databricks workspaces and data sources.
- **Pipeline Deployment**: Use a service principal for pipeline deployment. This service principal must be added to all workspaces as an admin and owner of the target catalog.

Use these Terraform scripts to streamline the deployment and management of your Databricks Unity Catalog infrastructure.
